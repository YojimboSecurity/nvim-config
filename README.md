# nvim

This is my nvim setup. Almost everything here was taken from <https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua>
Here is a link to the video he did <https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE>.

## Getting Started

### Installing Neovim

You can install Neovim with the package manager. However, those tend to be behind.
I recomend installing the latest version with the following.

```shell

```

### Dependancies

- ripgrep

- gcc

- g++

- clang

- npm

You will need ripgrep installed for fuzzy finding and other searches.
LSP will need gcc, clang, and g++ to compile.
You will also need npm to install most LSP language packs.
